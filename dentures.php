<h2>Dentures</h2><p>Unfortunately, even with our best treatment options, sometimes people end up losing all of their teeth, and needing dentures.  Even in this situation, there are still options.  If you need dentures, your main concern shouldn't be "How fast can you get them done?".  It should be "How well will you make them?".  There are several steps to the denture process, with lab work that needs to be done between each step.  Many dentists will skip vital steps to get them done faster, with fewer visits.  This usually results in a denture that is either uncomfortable or unesthetic, or sometimes both! Here are the steps, and the importance of each:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Initial impressions.  Because everyone has a different size and shape mouth, we don't have impression trays
that perfectly fit everyone.  So, we use the best fitting tray we can find, and take an initial impression. This is then sent to the lab to make a custom impression tray that fits only you.</li>
	<li>Final impressions.  The custom impression tray is used to take a super accurate impression of your mouth where the denture will fit.  This is a vital step.  Often dentures have sore spots or poor suction due to an inadequate impression.  The impressions are then sent to the lab to make wax rims that will be used to relate the upper and lower jaws to each other so that the dentures bite together properly.</li>
	<li>Wax bite.  The wax rims are adjusted so that they bite together evenly, and that you can speak properly in the position they are in.  Then a bite registration is done with the wax rims so that the lab can relate your upper and lower jaws just as they are.  This produces a denture that bites properly and that you can speak properly with.</li>
	<li>Try in.  This is the final step before completion.  The laboratory makes your denture out of wax, rather than plastic.  This allows us an opportunity to see exactly how the denture will look and bite together.  It gives you a chance to approve the shade and placement of the teeth before the denture is completed.  Upon your approval, the denture is sent to the lab for completion.</li>
	<li>Delivery.  This is the day you have been waiting for!  The final visit, however, is more than just handing you the dentures and wishing you luck.  We will place a paste inside the dentures to check for pressure spots.  We will also adjust the bite.  Most of all, we will make sure it feels comfortable to you.  We will then set up a post op adjustment visit for you since it is normal to have some sore spots and minor bite issues as you adjust to your new dentures.</li>

</ol>

<p>All these visits are necessary to make the most comfortable and functional denture possible.  Just like every other procedure we do, we do not skimp on the details, because the details are the difference between "acceptable' and "great".</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, due to the amount of bone a patient has for the denture to rest on, it's impossible for a denture to be comfortable or function well.  When that is the case, we will recommend a treatment plan that includes dental implants to secure your dentures.  Dental implants allow dentures to function at almost the same level as natural teeth.</p>
