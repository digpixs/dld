<h2>Laser Root Canal</h2><p>The laser has many uses in our office.  We are one of the very few office using this cutting edge technology. One of my favorite uses for the laser is in root canal therapy.  I hope the words "root canal" don't make you stop reading and move on to another page!  I believe root canals have an undeserved reputation.  When they are done properly, on a person who is completely numb, they are very comfortable, with minimal post-op discomfort.  This is where the laser really makes a difference.  The nerve canal inside the root is not a straight tube.  It is often ribbon shaped, with small offshoots and branches that are very hard to completely clean out.  The laser is used to send small shock waves down the root canal to vibrate out nerve tissue and debris, and completely circulate the disinfection solutions to kill more bacteria inside the root canal than any other method.  I couldn't picture doing a root canal without the laser, it's that effective.</p>
