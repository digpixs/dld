<h1>Composite Fillings Turnersville</h1><p>Composite resin fillings are bonded fillings that are the same shade as your tooth, and blend in naturally (unlike silver-mercury amalgams).  They bond strongly to your tooth to prevent fractures.  They are much more technique sensitive to place than silver-mercury amalgam fillings.  It is vitally important to properly isolate the tooth to keep it perfectly clean and free of saliva.  It is also very important to use the best materials possible and follow their directions exactly.  It normally takes about twice as long to place a properly done composite filling vs a silver-mercury amalgam.  Our office does not place silver-mercury amalgam fillings.</p>
