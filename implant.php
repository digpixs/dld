	<h2>How can I benefit from dental implants?</h2>
	<p>Are you one of the 178 million people in the USA who have lost one or more teeth? Is it uncomfortable to chew because of missing teeth? Or, worse yet, are you embarrassed to smile because your missing tooth is visible? Perhaps you have had teeth replaced
		with a removable denture (either partial or full), and you want a tooth replacement option that is more natural looking, and won't pop out at an embarrassing moment. If any of these questions apply to you, dental implants may be the solution you have
		been looking for.</p>

	<h2>What exactly is a dental implant?</h2>
	<p>A dental implant is an artificial, titanium root that is implanted in the jaw. This artificial root then serves as the platform for tooth replacement. These tooth replacement options can be anything from one tooth to all of your teeth.</p>
