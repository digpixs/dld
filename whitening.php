		<h3>Do you want a "movie star white" smile?</h3>

	<p>We have several different tooth whitening options available at our office. We can help you decide which is right for you. Many people wonder why they should have whitening done at a dental office rather than just buy Crest Whitestrips. Basically there
		are two reasons why:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Whitening should ALWAYS be supervised by a dentist because any areas of decay or recession should be identified before whitening, as they may become sensitive.</li>
		<li>Because over the counter whitening products have to be shipped in hot trucks, stored in stockrooms, and sit on store shelves, they are acidic in nature, to preserve the whitening chemicals. This can cause a lot of sensitivity. The products used in our
			office don't have to be acidic because they are refrigerated at the factory, shipped fresh, and remain refrigerated at our office until they are dispensed to you. This produces very little sensitivity.</li>
	</ol>
