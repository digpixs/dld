<h1>What is a laser sealant?</h1><p>First, the Waterlase dental laser is used to clean any plaque and bacteria out of the grooves on the chewing surface of a molar or premolar (the back teeth).  These grooves are often not completely closed, and allow cavity forming bacteria to get inside the tooth where your toothbrush cannot reach, causing cavities.  After the groove is clean, we bond a very thin filling into the groove.  This seals it and prevents decay causing bacteria from entering the tooth.  Traditional dental sealants often omit the step that cleans out the grooves.  Debris (plaque, food, etc) left in the groove will prevent proper bonding of the sealant, causing early failure.  Cleaning the grooves with the laser prevents this.</p>
