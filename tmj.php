<h2>TMJ/facial pain</h2><p>TMJ/facial pain affects a great many adults.  It can be due to injury, grinding/clenching habits, or arthritis in the joint.  Many times these pains mimic tooth pain, and people have multiple root canals done before they figure out it isn't the teeth causing the pain.  The most common form we see results from night time grinding (called bruxism).  The most common symptoms are headaches in the morning, pain in the jaw area, gum recession, tooth erosion, and excessive wear on the teeth, often causing chipping or cracking of teeth.  The most common treatment is also quite simple- an appliance that you wear at night to prevent the grinding and cushion your teeth.  The most important aspect of the appliance is that it is custom made to your bite, which decreases 
grinding activity significantly.  The store bought "make it yourself at home" appliance often causes an INCREASE in grinding because the bite and design are incorrect.  We strongly recommend against any type of over the counter appliance.</p>
