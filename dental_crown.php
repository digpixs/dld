<h1>Dental Crown Turnersville</h1><p>A dental crown (cap) is done when a tooth is severely damaged due to trauma or decay, is cracked, or has had a root canal done.  The tooth is trimmed by about 2mm from the top and around the sides.  An impression is made, and our lab makes a crown that precisely fits over the tooth, and restores it to proper function.  Crowns are made from porcelain, porcelain over gold alloy, or zirconium. We will choose a material based on the functional and aesthetic needs of your mouth. </p>
