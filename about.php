    <h1>Terri Brown</h1>
    <p>My name is Terri Brown. I am a dental hygienist and the newest member of the Dayspring family. I am very happy to join such a wonderful office with all the latest technologies and coworkers who really believe that exceptional patient care is of the utmost importance. I grew up here in Washington Township. After graduation, I went on to Camden County College to earn my associates in Dental Hygiene. I returned to earn my local anesthesia permit. I also attend seminars yearly to stay current and continue learning. I have worked as a dental hygienist for twenty four years now and I believe I will never want to do anything else. I enjoy interacting with all of the patients and giving the best dental care possible. I really love what I do. I live in Pitman with my husband and two children. I have been a Girl Scout leader for nine years. I am a canoe instructor and an archery instructor. I also am a cantor at my church. My family and I love to camp, geocache together. I look forward to seeing all of you soon.</p>

    <h1>About Us - Dayspring Dental</h1>
    <p>We met in dental school, attended our residency training together, and were married in 1993. It was always our dream to have an office together, and that dream became a reality in 1998. We have 2 daughters, Katarina (a culinary student at Johnson and Wales University), and Julianna (a student at Washington Twp HS). We love the town we live and practice in, and are proud to call Washington Twp our home. In 1998 we opened Dayspring Laser Dentistry with one main goal: To provide comfortable dentistry in a relaxing, stress free environment. Let's face it, nobody likes going to the dentist. We realize this, so we try to provide something different and unique in dental care: A fun place to be! Any time you visit our office, you will hear laughter coming from one or more of the rooms. Why? Because we enjoy what we do, and we enjoy making our patients laugh! But there is a very serious side to what we do. We believe that the quality of the work you do shows who you really are deep down. So, we have sought to provide the very best care possible in three major areas: #1- Technology. The Waterlase dental laser eliminates the drill in many cases. The Wand computerized anesthesia machine eliminates the old fashioned metal syringe, and replaces it with comfort. Digital x-rays allow us to catch problems earlier, treating them more conservatively. #2- Materials. We have researched dental materials and laboratories, and we provide our patients with the best available. A long lasting filling or crown requires the best materials available.#3- Personalized attention. We make every effort to keep a timely schedule, and not keep anyone waiting. We DO NOT double-book our appointments. Your appointment time will not be shared with anyone else, so that you have our full attention.</p>
