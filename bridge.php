		<h1>Dental Bridges Turnersville</h1></br>
		<p>A bridge is a method of replacing one or more missing teeth with a series of crowns fused together to allow for a non-removable tooth replacement.  Although implants are now the best choice for tooth replacement, sometimes a bridge is still the treatment of choice for some patients.  The disadvantage is that healthy teeth may have to be cut down for crowns to place a bridge.  When replacing teeth with dental implants, this is not necessary.</p>
