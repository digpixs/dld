		<h1>Orthodontics</h1></br>
			<p>At Dayspring Laser Dentistry, we understand how important it is have a beautiful smile, which includes – first and foremost – straight and perfectly aligned teeth.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, an incorrect positioning of their teeth is not only a problem in itself but it can also cause a variety of other dental issues. People with large overbites are at a greater risk for trauma, which would require extensive procedures such as root canals, etc. Poorly positioned teeth can put you at a greater risk of cavities and gum disease, because it is more difficult to perform the proper daily dental hygiene routine. You are more likely to grind misaligned teeth, causing wear, chips	and fractures, as well as TMJ (jaw joint) problems. To prevent these issues and provide you with a beautiful and healthy smile, we have made it our top priority to address orthodontic concerns as part of your overall dental care.</p></br>

		<h2>Braces for Children</h2>
			<p>For a child, it is important to promote proper growth, and because teeth are anchored to the jaw bone, poorly aligned teeth can negatively affect the growth of the face. That is why the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) recommends that your child is brought in for their first orthodontist appointment at approximately the age of seven.</p></br>

		<h2>Braces for Adults</h2>
			<p>As an adult, i.e., aged 15 or older, you might have had a relapse from previous orthodontics or you’ve simply never had prior treatment to correct your uneven teeth. Rest assured that it’s not too late – Six month braces may be your solution!</p></br>

		<h2>6 month Braces</h2>
		<p>Six month braces are thin, tooth-colored wires attached to your front teeth, gradually moving them to their ideal position. Although they are called “six month braces,” the treatment time commonly ranges between four to nine months. These braces are also
		designed to focus solely on the front teeth and do not provide major improvements to bite issues. However, if you do not have a major dental issue and your goal is to prevent self-consciousness in social situation, then this treatment plan is perfect for you.</p></br>
